Small note on how to create a WaterTreatmentSystem.fwi

The WaterTreatmentSystem.fwi file is the binary image with corrected CRC
that needs to go into the /home/ccp/ directory of a CCP in order to allow
the ccp application to update the firmware of the water treatment system board.
A tool to create this file can be found in the directory ./tools/iar2wts_bin
and is called iar2wts_bin.exe.  This converts a WaterTreatmentSystem.txt file into a WaterTreatmentSystem.fwi file, and needs to be run from the directory 
containing the WaterTreatmentSsytem.txt file.
The WaterTreatmentSystem.txt file is generated by the IAR compiler.
